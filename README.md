INTRODUCTION:

ecoSort is a waste segregation app that promotes eco-friendly practises.
This app has multiple features that show immense potential in both the industrial and residential scenarios.

FOR INDUSTRIAL PURPOSE: 
The app has...

• An AI powered camera, built using Google Cloud Vision API. This allows us to segregate clusters of waste, into Biodegradable, Recyclable and Needs Segregation. It basically calculates the percentages of various materials and does the classification.

 This can be used in landfills and waste collection hubs to classify waste into general categories and makes the whole process easier and more efficient.


FOR RESIDENT PURPOSES the app features: 

• A games and daily tasks tab that help the user feel rewarded for being more eco-friendly.
•A tab for showing nearby recycling centers classified into recycling centers, landfills, etc.
• The AI camera can also be used for waste segregation at homes, as it can scan multiple objects at once to display a result.


FUTURE ADDITIONS TO THIS APP:

This app was envisioned to be developed into two app that can be used as both residential (ecoSort) and Industrial (ecoSort Synergy) solutions to the waste problems.

 ADDITIONS TO ecoSort: 

• Option to host recycling and awareness events.
• Co-operate with local recycling centers to incentivize the user.
• Option for home collection of waste.
• Recycling tips for user, and information on environment.


ADDITIONS TO ecoSort Synergy:

• Option for industrial units to link with users and collect waste.
• Integration into robot arms that can classify waste at collection centers.

THE APP USES:
• Flutter for FRONT END
• Google APIs:
    •Google Cloud Vision 
    • Google maps 
      As a BACKEND

This app was developed as a part of the HACKS'US Hackathon event conducted at Rajagiri School of Engineering and Technology.
